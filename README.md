Year 8 Science project to measure reaction times

This file is a simple windows form to measure people's reaction times.
The process:
Starts with a key-press
Waits a short, random time
Changes the colour of the screen
When the screen changes colour the testee presses the key again
The length of time taken between the change of colour and the key-press is measured
